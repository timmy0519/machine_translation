This is a project in my NLP class. The target is implementing a machine translation model with english and chinese embedding. As it is only a homework, it doesn't have a lot requirement to meet.
Basically, it only trains on origial dataset without test data, but I hope I can have time to make it become more complete. 
At this stage of this project, it has implemented following features...

1.  pretrain glove embedding for english word.
2.  data generators for keras
3.  seq2seq machine translation model for keras(also mainly refer to the one on offical website of keras)

TODO:
1.  Refer to different version of seq2seq keras model.
2.  Add more data, and seperate whole dataset into valid,test data.
