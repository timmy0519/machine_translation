This is a project in my NLP class. The target is implementing a machine translation model with english and chinese embedding. As it is only a homework, it doesn't have a lot requirement to meet.
Basically, it only trains on origial dataset without test data, but I hope I can have time to make it become more complete. 
At this stage of this project, it has implemented following features...

<h1>Features:</h1>

1.  pre-train glove embedding for english words.
2.  data generator for keras
3.  seq2seq machine translation model for keras(I also mainly reference to the the offical github of keras-team)

<h1>Todo:</h1>

1.  Refer to different version of seq2seq keras model.
2.  Add more data, and seperate whole dataset into valid,test data.
